# Description of the Course and Learning Objectives

Computers and computational methods are essential tools in many areas of modern biological research. This course teaches the theory and practice of programming for life sciences applications. The course will introduce students to key concepts in programming using R. Applications covered include computational statistics and data analysis, simulation of biological systems, genomics and bioinformatics, and machine learning. The course will emphasize thoughtful and meaningful use of computational methods as tools for life scientists. By the end of the course students will be able to:

1. Identify and explain major applications of computational methods in biology.
2. Write their own computer scripts and programs to explore and analyze biological data.

These course-specific learning objectives align with the following IDEA learning objectives and USU Biology Department learning outcomes.

### IDEA Center Learning Objectives

- Learning appropriate methods for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting numerical information.
- Gaining a basic understanding of the subject (e.g., factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories).

### Biology Department Learning Outcomes

- Graduates will be able to use quantitative reasoning, modeling, and simulation to solve problems in biology.
- Graduates will be able to practice the process of science.
- Distinguish scientific integrity and the ethical practice of science from deceitful and unethical scientific practices.

# Course Materials

**Course fees:** The fee for this course is $150. This covers part of the cost of a laptop computer.

- **Canvas:** Use the course Canvas site to receive announcements, download class materials, submit assignments, take quizzes and exams, and view grades. Make sure you receive daily notifications for announcements.
- **Textbook:** A textbook is not required for this course. Good programming references for R can be found online. Nonetheless, I recommend gaining access to the following book:
  - R. Cotton. 2013. *Learning R: A Step-by-Step Function Guide to Data Analysis*. 1st edition. O’Reilly Media.
- **Laptop computer:** A computer capable of running R is required for this course. Such a computer will be provided for you to use for the semester (your course fees cover part of the computer cost). You may use your own computer if you prefer, but you are responsible for ensuring the required software is installed and runs properly. If you check out a class laptop, you are required to return it before the end of the course. Failure to do so will result in an incomplete for the class until the computer is returned.

# Attendance and Participation

Computational biology is a hands-on class. Most weeks will include some lecture to introduce concepts, but we will spend a considerable amount of time in class with live-coding exercises and programming in small groups. Coming to class regularly, with a computer, and prepared to work is thus critical for your success. With that said, I realize that you will sometimes need to miss class (especially if you are sick). That is fine. I will try to record the lecture each class and will provide handouts and slides that should help you catch up on material you miss. Regardless of attendance and participation in class, your success likely depends on regularly reviewing the course material and practicing your programming skills outside of class time too.

# Meeting Course Objectives: Assignments & Assessment

Three types of graded assignments will be used to evaluate student performance in the context of the course objectives: coding quizzes, programming projects, and exams. Brief descriptions of each assignment type follow. See Canvas for more information. Due dates for all assignments can be found on Canvas. Unless arrangements are made with me, late work will not be accepted. In other words, contact me in a timely manner if you have a planned, excused absence or fall ill so that we can work out a plan for late work.

### Coding Quizzes (10%)

Short (3-5 questions) coding quizzes will be given once every few weeks to assess programming skills (7 total). You will take these quizzes via Canvas. Most weeks, the coding quiz will be available starting Monday and will close Friday at 11:59 pm. You will be able to take the quiz at any time during that time interval. You will be allowed to take each quiz a total of 3 times and only your highest score will be retained.

### Programming Projects (50%)

Hands-on experience is essential to mastering computational biology. Thus, a key focus of this course will be regular programming projects, 6 total. This will involve applying coding skills we have covered to problems in the biological sciences. Each project will culminate in:
1. Annotated computer code or
2. A write-up/interpretation along with embedded computer code and visualizations.

### Midterm Exam (18%) and Final Exam (22%)

Two exams will be given, a midterm and a final exam. These will cover programming skills and knowledge of key application concepts covered in the course, and thus build on the quizzes and projects. The exams will be administered through Canvas.

### Summary and Grading Policy

**Grading Policy:** Final course grades are based on the following scale and will not be rounded up to the nearest whole number:

- A (93 to 100%)
- A- (90 to <93%)
- B+ (87 to <90%)
- B (83 to <87%)
- B- (80 to <83%)
- C+ (77 to <80%)
- C (73 to <77%)
- C- (70 to <73%)
- D+ (67 to <70%)
- D (60 to <67%)
- F (0% to <60%)

**Breakdown:**

- Coding quizzes: 10%
- Programming projects: 50%
- Midterm exam: 18%
- Final exam: 22%

# Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI

Large language models (a component of some generative AI), such as ChatGPT, can be useful tools in computational biology but can also hinder meaningful learning and mastery of programming for biologists. I will cover some best practices for using such AI software as “programming assistants” during the course. With this in mind, we will have two distinct policies for the use of such software in this class.

### Use of LLMs and Generative AI on Programming Projects

You are permitted to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to assist you in these projects. However, you are expected to include a disclosure statement at the end of your assignment describing which AI tool you used and how you used it. For example, “ChatGPT was used to draft about 50 percent of the code and text in this assignment. AI-produced content was edited for accuracy and style.”

### Use of LLMs and Generative AI on Quizzes and Exams

ChatGPT and similar Artificial Intelligence tools, though useful in many contexts, are inappropriate for use when taking quizzes and exams in this course. An important outcome of this course is to strengthen your own abilities as a thinker and programmer. You need to know when AI produces code that does versus doesn’t do what you want, and you need to understand coding concepts on your own. For me to assess your abilities to do these things, it is important for you to take quizzes and exams without the use of AI. Thus, you may not use AI when taking quizzes or exams. If your submission appears to have been written using AI, you may either receive a failing grade or be asked to resubmit. Using AI to study for quizzes and exams is absolutely fine.

# Schedule of Topics
